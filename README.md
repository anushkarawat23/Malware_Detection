# Malware_Detection

Cyberattacks are currently the most pressing concern in the realm of modern technology.
For this project, we are concerned with the detection of one particular type of cyberattack known as Malware.

Malware is any program or set of instructions that are designed to harm a computer, user, business, or computer system. The term “malware” encompasses a wide range of threats, including viruses, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, rogue software, wipers, scareware, and so on. Malicious software, by definition, is any piece of code that is run without the user’s knowledge or consent 
In this project, we propose a machine learning-based approach for the detection of malware on Android devices using the attributes extracted from Android applications as features.

In this project, we aim to extract meaningful features from Android applications that can be used to identify malware accurately. These features include information about the application's permissions, activities, services, and receivers. We use these attributes as input to our machine learning model, which is trained to distinguish between benign and malicious applications.

In this project, we used a dataset consisting of 5560 malware samples and 9476 benign samples to train and evaluate a neural network-based malware detection model. The dataset was pre-processed by removing missing values and performing label encoding. We then split the dataset into training and testing sets. We evaluated the model's performance using some evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also plotted the model's performance over the training and validation sets using a confusion matrix.
